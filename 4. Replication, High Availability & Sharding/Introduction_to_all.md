# PostgreSQL Replication, High Availability, and Sharding

PostgreSQL replication techniques, high availability setups, and sharding strategies. This will cover everything from basic concepts to advanced implementation details.

## Replication Techniques in PostgreSQL

### 1. Physical (Streaming) Replication

Physical replication works by copying the actual data files and WAL (Write-Ahead Log) records from the primary server to replicas.

#### How Streaming Replication Works:

- Based on WAL (Write-Ahead Log) shipping
- Replicas operate in continuous recovery mode
- Changes are applied byte-by-byte exactly as they occur on the primary
- Creates exact copies of the entire database cluster

#### Key Components:

- **WAL Segments**: Sequential log of changes to the database files
- **WAL Sender**: Process on the primary that sends WAL to replicas
- **WAL Receiver**: Process on the replica that receives and applies WAL data

#### Advantages:

- Simple to set up and maintain
- Low overhead on the primary server
- Exact byte-for-byte replication (includes all databases)
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes

#### Limitations:

- Replicas are read-only
- Entire database cluster is replicated (cannot replicate selectively)
- All replicas must run the same PostgreSQL version

### 2. Logical Replication

Logical replication works at the SQL level, replicating changes based on their effects rather than the physical byte changes.

#### How Logical Replication Works:

- Uses a publish/subscribe model
- Replicates individual tables based on their row changes
- Converts changes to logical replication protocol

#### Key Components:

- **Publisher**: The upstream database publishing changes
- **Subscriber**: The downstream database receiving changes
- **Publication**: Set of tables to be replicated
- **Subscription**: Connection from subscriber to publisher

#### Advantages:

- Selective replication (specific tables/databases)
- Cross-version compatibility
- Writable replicas
- Supports heterogeneous environments
- Can be used for data migration and integration

#### Limitations:

- Higher overhead than streaming replication
- Does not replicate schema changes automatically
- More complex to set up and maintain
- Does not replicate large objects or DDL changes by default

## High Availability Setups

### 1. Patroni

Patroni is a template for managing PostgreSQL clusters with automatic failover.

#### Architecture:

- Uses a distributed configuration store (etcd, Consul, ZooKeeper)
- Implements a state machine for PostgreSQL high availability
- Manages leader election and failover processes

#### Key Features:

- Automatic failover
- Customizable failover logic
- REST API for cluster management
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication
- Flexible deployment options

#### Components:

- **Distributed Configuration Store**: Maintains cluster state and leader information
- **Watchdog**: Monitors PostgreSQL server health
- **REST API**: Provides cluster management interface

### 2. pgpool-II

pgpool-II is a middleware that sits between PostgreSQL servers and client applications.

#### Architecture:

- Connection pooling
- Load balancing
- Query routing
- Automated failover

#### Key Features:

- Connection pooling reduces overhead
- Load balancing across multiple replicas
- Read/write splitting to direct queries appropriately
- Automatic failover if a node fails
- Query cache for improved performance

#### Components:

- **pgpool-II Process**: Middleware server
- **Watchdog**: Monitors pgpool and PostgreSQL nodes
- **Virtual IP Manager**: Handles IP reassignment during failover

### 3. pgBouncer

pgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL.

#### Architecture:

- Single-purpose connection pooler
- Maintains pools of connections for different databases
- Routes client connections to server connections

#### Key Features:

- Lightweight with minimal overhead
- Multiple pooling modes (session, transaction, statement)
- Connection limits and queue management
- Administrative console for monitoring

#### Components:

- **pgBouncer Process**: Main pooling server
- **Configuration**: Pool configurations and access control
- **Administrative Console**: Management interface

## Sharding Strategies

Sharding involves partitioning data across multiple PostgreSQL instances.

### 1. Application-Level Sharding

#### How it Works:

- Application determines which shard contains specific data
- Uses consistent hashing or modulo algorithms to route queries

#### Implementation:

- Custom application logic for routing
- Shard-aware ORM or data access layer

#### Advantages:

- Complete control over sharding logic
- Can optimize for specific access patterns
- No additional middleware required

#### Limitations:

- Increases application complexity
- Difficult to change sharding scheme
- Application must handle cross-shard queries

### 2. Middleware-Based Sharding

#### How it Works:

- Proxy server routes queries to appropriate shards
- Middleware aggregates results from multiple shards

#### Implementation Options:

- **Citus**: Extension for distributed PostgreSQL
- **ProxySQL**: SQL proxy with routing capabilities
- **Custom middleware**: Specialized for specific requirements

#### Advantages:

- Application remains unaware of sharding
- Centralized shard management
- Supports cross-shard queries

#### Limitations:

- Additional latency from middleware layer
- Single point of failure without proper HA
- Complex setup and maintenance

### 3. PostgreSQL Native Partitioning

#### How it Works:

- Uses PostgreSQL's declarative partitioning
- Can be combined with foreign data wrappers for cross-instance partitioning

#### Implementation:

- Table partitioning by range, list, or hash
- Foreign data wrappers to access remote tables

#### Advantages:

- Native PostgreSQL feature
- Query planner handles partition pruning
- Simpler maintenance than full sharding

#### Limitations:

- Limited to single PostgreSQL instance (unless using FDW)
- Less scalable than true sharding
- Overhead for maintaining partition metadata

I'll now create a comprehensive guide for setting up PostgreSQL replication.

I've created a comprehensive guide on PostgreSQL replication and high availability. Here are some key points to understand about these crucial topics:

## Replication Fundamentals

PostgreSQL offers two main replication methods:

1. **Physical (Streaming) Replication**:

   - Replicates the entire database cluster at the binary level
   - Works with Write-Ahead Log (WAL) shipping
   - Creates exact replicas that are read-only
   - Simpler to set up but less flexible

2. **Logical Replication**:
   - Uses a publication/subscription model
   - Works at the SQL/row level rather than binary data
   - Allows selective replication of specific tables
   - Supports different PostgreSQL versions and writable replicas

## High Availability Tools

There are several tools to implement high availability:

1. **Patroni**:

   - Framework for PostgreSQL HA with automatic failover
   - Uses distributed configuration stores (etcd/Consul/ZooKeeper)
   - Manages the promotion of replicas during failures
   - Provides a robust solution for mission-critical deployments

2. **pgpool-II**:

   - Connection pooling, load balancing, and query routing
   - Automatic failover capability
   - Read/write splitting to optimize performance

3. **pgBouncer**:
   - Lightweight connection pooler
   - Reduces database connection overhead
   - Different pooling modes for different workloads

## Sharding Strategies

When your database outgrows a single instance, sharding can help:

1. **Application-level sharding**: Your application directs queries to appropriate shards based on data distribution rules
2. **Middleware-based sharding**: Tools like Citus distribute data across multiple PostgreSQL instances
3. **Native partitioning**: PostgreSQL's built-in partitioning can serve as a limited form of sharding

The detailed guide in the artifact provides step-by-step instructions for setting up each of these technologies, along with monitoring strategies, failover procedures, and advanced configurations.
